question: I run a domain that uses cookies or other tracking. How do I stop Privacy Badger from blocking me?

One way is to stop tracking users who have turned on Global Privacy Control or Do Not Track signals (i.e., stop collecting cookies, supercookies or fingerprints from them). Privacy Badger will stop learning to block that domain. The next version of Privacy Badger to ship with an updated pre-trained list will no longer include that domain in the list. Most Privacy Badger users will then update to that list.

You can also unblock yourself by promising to meaningfully respect the Do Not Track signal. To do so, post a _verbatim_ copy of [EFF's Do Not Track policy](https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy) to the URL https://example.com/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt, where "example.com" is replaced by your domain. Posting EFF's DNT policy on a domain is a promise of compliance with EFF's DNT Policy by that domain.

If your domain is compliant with EFF's DNT policy and declares this compliance, most Privacy Badgers will see this declaration the next time they encounter your domain. Also, the next version of Privacy Badger to ship with an updated pre-trained list will probably include your declaration of compliance in the list.

Note that the domain must support HTTPS, to protect against tampering by network attackers. The path contains ".well-known" per [RFC 5785](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785). Also note that you must post a copy of the policy at each compliant subdomain you control. For example, if you wish to declare compliance by both sub1.example.com and sub2.example.com, you must post EFF's DNT policy on each domain.
