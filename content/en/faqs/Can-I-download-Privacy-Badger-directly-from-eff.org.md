If you use Google Chrome, you have to install extensions from Chrome Web Store. To install Privacy Badger in Chrome, visit [Privacy Badger's Chrome Web Store listing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp) and click the "Add to Chrome" button there.

Otherwise, you can use the following links to get the latest version of Privacy Badger directly from eff.org:

* Firefox: [https://www.eff.org/files/privacy-badger-latest.xpi](https://www.eff.org/files/privacy-badger-latest.xpi)
* Chromium: [https://www.eff.org/files/privacy_badger-chrome.crx](https://www.eff.org/files/privacy_badger-chrome.crx)
