Safari/iOS: [Safari seems to lack certain extension capabilities](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/issues/549#issuecomment-744583479) required by Privacy Badger to function properly.

Chrome on Android does not support extensions. To use Privacy Badger on Android, install [Firefox for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox).

Privacy Badger does not work with [Microsoft Edge Legacy](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4533505/what-is-microsoft-edge-legacy). Please switch to the new [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) browser.
