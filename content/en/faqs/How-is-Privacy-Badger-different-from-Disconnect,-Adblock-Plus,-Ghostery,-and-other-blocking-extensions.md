question: How is Privacy Badger different from other blocking extensions?

Privacy Badger was born out of our desire to be able to recommend a single extension that would:

- Automatically analyze and block any tracker or ad that violated the principle of user consent
- Function well without any settings, knowledge, or configuration by the user
- Use algorithmic methods to decide what is and isn't tracking
- Be produced by an organization that is unambiguously working for its users rather than for profit

As a result, Privacy Badger differs from traditional ad-blocking extensions in two key ways. First, while most other blocking extensions prioritize blocking ads, Privacy Badger doesn't block ads unless they happen to be tracking you; in fact, one of our goals is to incentivize advertisers to adopt better privacy practices.

Second, most other blockers rely on a human-curated list of domains or URLs to block. Privacy Badger is an algorithmic tracker blocker -- we define what “tracking” looks like, and then Privacy Badger blocks or restricts domains that it observes tracking in the wild. What is and isn’t considered a tracker is entirely based on how a specific domain acts, not on human judgment.

Privacy Badger sends the [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) signal to opt you out of data sharing and selling, and the [Do Not Track](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track) signal to tell companies not to track you. If trackers ignore these signals, Privacy Badger will learn to block them.

Beyond this, Privacy Badger comes with other advantages like cookie blocking, [click-to-activate placeholders](#How-does-Privacy-Badger-handle-social-media-widgets) for potentially useful tracker widgets (video players, comments widgets, etc.), and outgoing link click tracking removal on [Facebook](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/privacy-badger-rolls-out-new-ways-fight-facebook-tracking) and [Google](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/10/privacy-badger-now-fights-more-sneaky-google-tracking).

By using Privacy Badger, you support the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) and help fight for a better Web for everybody.
