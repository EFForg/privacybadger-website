When you install Privacy Badger, your browser warns that Privacy Badger can "access your data for all websites" (in Firefox, or "read and change all your data on the websites you visit" in Chrome). You are right to be alarmed. You should only install extensions made by organizations you trust.

Privacy Badger requires these permissions to do its job of automatically detecting and blocking trackers on all websites you visit. We are not ironically (or unironically) spying on you. For more information, see our [Privacy Badger extension permissions explainer](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/blob/master/doc/permissions.md).

Note that the extension permissions warnings only cover what the extension has access to, not what the extension actually does with what it has access to (such as whether the extension secretly uploads your browsing data to its servers). Privacy Badger will never share data about your browsing unless you choose to share it (by filing a broken site report). For more information, see EFF's [Privacy Policy for Software](https://www.eff.org/code/privacy/policy).
