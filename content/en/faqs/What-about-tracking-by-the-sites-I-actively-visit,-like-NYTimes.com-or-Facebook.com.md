question: What about tracking by the sites I actively visit, like NYTimes.com or Facebook.com?

At present, Privacy Badger primarily protects you against tracking by third party sites. As far as privacy protections for "first party" sites (sites that you visit directly), Privacy Badger removes outgoing link click tracking on [Facebook](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/privacy-badger-rolls-out-new-ways-fight-facebook-tracking) and [Google](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/10/privacy-badger-now-fights-more-sneaky-google-tracking). We plan on adding more first party privacy protections in the future.

We are doing things in this order because the most scandalous, intrusive and objectionable form of online tracking is that conducted by companies you've [often never heard of](https://lumapartners.com/content/lumascapes/display-ad-tech-lumascape/) and have no relationship with. First and foremost, Privacy Badger is there to enforce Do Not Track against these domains by providing the technical means to restrict access to their tracking scripts and images. The right policy for whether nytimes.com, facebook.com or google.com can track you _when you visit that site_ – and the technical task of preventing it – is more complicated because often tracking is interwoven with the features the site offers.
