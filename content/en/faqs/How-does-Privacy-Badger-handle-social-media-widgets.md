Social media widgets (such as the Facebook Like button) often track your reading habits. Even if you don't click them, the social media companies often see exactly which pages you're seeing the widget on. When blocking social buttons and other potentially useful (video, audio, comments) widgets, [Privacy Badger can replace them](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/privacy-badger-puts-you-control-widgets) with click-to-activate placeholders. You will not be tracked by these replacements unless you explicitly choose to click them.
