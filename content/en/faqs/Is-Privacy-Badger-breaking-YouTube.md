Issues with YouTube while Privacy Badger is enabled are usually not caused by Privacy Badger. However, try temporarily disabling Privacy Badger for YouTube to see if that resolves the issue: Navigate to YouTube, click the Privacy Badger icon in your browser toolbar, and click "Disable for this site" in the popup.

If disabling Privacy Badger for YouTube fixes the issues, check if re-enabling Privacy Badger breaks YouTube again. If that’s the case, please [reach out to us directly](#I-found-a-bug%21-What-do-I-do-now). We'd be happy to investigate further.

Are you surprised that advertisements aren’t being blocked on YouTube? Privacy Badger is primarily a privacy-protecting tool, [not an ad blocker](#Why-doesn%27t-Privacy-Badger-block-all-ads). YouTube advertisements are not blocked because they are not [tracking you with “third party” sites](#What-is-a-third-party-tracker). You can learn more about why Privacy Badger primarily protects against third party tracking [here](#What-about-tracking-by-the-sites-I-actively-visit%2c-like-NYTimes.com-or-Facebook.com).
