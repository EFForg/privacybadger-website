Is YouTube not working? Try [disabling Privacy Badger](#I-found-a-bug%21-What-do-I-do-now) on YouTube. If that resolves the issue, see if re-enabling Privacy Badger breaks YouTube again. If YouTube goes back to not working, please [tell us](#I-found-a-bug%21-What-do-I-do-now) so we can look into what's going on.

Are you surprised that ads aren't being blocked on YouTube? Privacy Badger is primarily a privacy tool, [not an ad blocker](#Why-doesn%27t-Privacy-Badger-block-all-ads). When you [visit YouTube directly](#What-about-tracking-by-the-sites-I-actively-visit%2c-like-NYTimes.com-or-Facebook.com), Privacy Badger does not block ads on YouTube because YouTube does not use ["third party" trackers](#What-is-a-third-party-tracker). If you really dislike ads, you can also install a traditional ad blocker.
