Thanks for asking! Individual donations make up about half of EFF's support, which gives us the freedom to work on user-focused projects. If you want to support the development of Privacy Badger and other projects like it, you can [throw us a few dollars here](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/support-privacy-badger). Thank you.

If you want to help directly with the project, we appreciate that as well. Please see [Privacy Badger's CONTRIBUTING document](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for ways to get started.
