question: What is Global Privacy Control (GPC)?

[Global Privacy Control (GPC)](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) is a new specification that allows users to tell companies they'd like to opt out of having their data shared or sold. By default, Privacy Badger sends the GPC signal to every company you interact with alongside the Do Not Track (DNT) signal.

What's the difference? Do Not Track is meant to tell companies that you don't want to be tracked in any way (learn more about what we mean by "tracking" [here](https://www.eff.org/pages/understanding-effs-do-not-track-policy-universal-opt-out-tracking)). Privacy Badger gives third-party companies a chance to comply with DNT by adopting [our DNT policy](https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy/), and blocks those that look like they're tracking you anyway.

When DNT was developed, many websites simply ignored usersâ€™ requests not to be tracked. That's why Privacy Badger has to act as an enforcer: trackers that don't want to comply with your wishes get blocked. Today, users in many jurisdictions have the legal right to opt out of some kinds of tracking. That's where GPC comes in.

GPC is meant to be a legally-binding request to all companies in places with applicable privacy laws. For example, [the California Consumer Privacy Act](https://theccpa.org) gives California residents the right to opt out of having their data sold. By sending the GPC signal, Privacy Badger is telling companies that you would like to exercise your rights.

The CCPA and other laws are [not perfect](https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/press_release/consumer-reports-study-finds-significant-obstacles-to-exercising-california-privacy-rights/), which is why Privacy Badger uses both approaches. It asks websites to respect your privacy, and it blocks known trackers from loading at all.
