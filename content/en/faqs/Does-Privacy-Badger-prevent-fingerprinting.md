Browser fingerprinting is an extremely subtle and problematic method of tracking, which we documented with the [Cover Your Tracks project](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/). Privacy Badger can detect [canvas-based fingerprinting](https://www.propublica.org/article/meet-the-online-tracking-device-that-is-virtually-impossible-to-block), and will block third party domains that use it. Detection of other forms of fingerprinting and protections against first-party fingerprinting are ongoing projects. Of course, once a domain is blocked by Privacy Badger, it will no longer be able to fingerprint you.
