Red means that content from this third party domain has been completely disallowed.

Yellow means that the third party domain appears to be trying to track you, but it is on Privacy Badger's cookie-blocking "yellowlist" of third party domains that, when analyzed, seemed to be necessary for Web functionality. In that case, Privacy Badger will load content from the domain but will try to screen out third party cookies and referrers from it.

Green means "no action"; Privacy Badger will leave the domain alone.
