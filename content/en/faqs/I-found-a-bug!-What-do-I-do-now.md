If a website isn't working like it should, you can disable Privacy Badger just for that site, leaving Privacy Badger enabled and protecting you everywhere else. To do so, navigate to the site with the problem, click on Privacy Badger's icon in your browser toolbar, and click the "**Disable for this site**" button in Privacy Badger's popup. You can also let us know about broken sites using the "**Report broken site**" button.

To get help or to report bugs, please email [extension-devs@eff.org](mailto:extension-devs@eff.org). If you have a GitHub account, you can use our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/issues).

You can also find us on Mastodon at [@privacybadger@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@privacybadger).
