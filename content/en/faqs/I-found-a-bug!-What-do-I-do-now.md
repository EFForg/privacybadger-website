* If **a website isn't working** like it should, you can disable Privacy Badger just for that site, leaving Privacy Badger enabled and protecting you everywhere else. To do so, navigate to the site with the problem, click on Privacy Badger's icon in your browser toolbar, and click the "**Disable for this site**" button in Privacy Badger's popup. You can also quickly let us know about broken sites by clicking on the "**Report broken site**" button.

* Did you run into "**An unexpected error occurred**" in Firefox? Your disk is probably low on space. All extensions have this problem; they just don't all tell you about it. To fix, free up some disk space and then restart Firefox. If that didn't help, please let us know (see below).

To get help or to report bugs, please email [extension-devs@eff.org](mailto:extension-devs@eff.org). If you have a GitHub account, you can use our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/issues).
