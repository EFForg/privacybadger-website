question: How was the cookie blocking yellowlist created?
weight: 100

The initial list of domains that should be cookie blocked rather than blocked entirely was derived from a [research project](https://jonathanmayer.org/papers_data/bau13.pdf) on classifying third party domains as trackers and non-trackers. We will make occasional adjustments to it as necessary. If you find domains that are under- or over-blocked, please [file a bug](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/issues) on Github.
