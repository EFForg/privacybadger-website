When you visit a webpage parts of the page may come from domains and servers other than the one you asked to visit.

On the modern Web, embedded images and code often use cookies and other methods to track your browsing habits â€” often to display advertisements. The domains that do this are called "third party trackers", and you can read more about how they work [here](https://www.eff.org/wp/behind-the-one-way-mirror).
