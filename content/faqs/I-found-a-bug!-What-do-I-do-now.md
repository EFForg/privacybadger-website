If something online isn't working like it should and you suspect that Privacy Badger might be the culprit, try turning the extension off (via the power button in the extension popup menu) and reloading the page you're currently on. If the page returns to normal, then Privacy Badger is indeed the issue. You can leave the extension off for that page and go back about your business. That said, we'd like to fix the issue for you, here's how to go about that:

To get help or to report bugs, please email [extension-devs@eff.org](mailto:extension-devs@eff.org). If you have a GitHub account, you can use our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/issues).

Were you led here by the popup with an error message that read "Unexpected Error Occurred" and you use Firefox browser? Chances are you're seeing a known issue that has to do with computer memory space. Your computer's disk space might be low; search "how to free up disk space" for your type of computer. If that doesn't work, the issue likely has more to do with your browser's memory space. Try restarting Firefox, or [refreshing your Firefox profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings) to free up space.
