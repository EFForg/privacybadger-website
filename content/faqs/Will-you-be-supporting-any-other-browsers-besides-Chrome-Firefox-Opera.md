Safari/iOS: Unfortunately, after legal review, [the EFF found Apple's developer agreement unacceptable](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/12/sorry-iphone-users-apples-dev-agreement-means-no-eff-mobile-app-iphone).

If you would like to help us port Privacy Badger to other platforms, please let us know!
