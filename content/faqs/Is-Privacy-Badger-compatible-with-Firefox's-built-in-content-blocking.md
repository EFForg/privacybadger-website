It's fine to use Firefox's native content blocking and Privacy Badger together.

While there is overlap between Firefox's tracker lists and Privacy Badger's protections, unlike list-based blockers, Privacy Badger automatically discovers trackers. This means that Privacy Badger's automatically-generated and regularly-updated blocklist may learn to block trackers that blockers with human-generated lists don't know about. And if you enable [local learning](#How-does-Privacy-Badger-work), your Badger will learn about the trackers you encounter as you browse as well.
