Privacy Badger should be compatible with other extensions.

While there is likely to be overlap between the various manually-edited advertising/tracker lists and Privacy Badger, unlike adblockers, Privacy Badger automatically learns to block trackers based on their behavior. This means that Privacy Badger may learn to block trackers your adblocker doesn't know about.

Besides automatic learning, Privacy Badger comes with other advantages like cookie blocking, [click-to-activate placeholders](##How-does-Privacy-Badger-handle-social-media-widgets) for potentially useful tracker widgets (video players, comments widgets, etc.), and outgoing link click tracking removal on [Facebook](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/privacy-badger-rolls-out-new-ways-fight-facebook-tracking) and [Google](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/10/privacy-badger-now-fights-more-sneaky-google-tracking).

Privacy Badger is also a political tool. Privacy Badger sends the [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) signal to opt you out of data sharing and selling, and the [Do Not Track](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track) signal to tell companies not to track you. If trackers ignore your wishes, Privacy Badger will learn to block them. By using Privacy Badger, you support the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) and help fight for a better Web for everybody.
