Privacy Badger should be compatible with other extensions.

While there is likely to be overlap between the various advertising/tracker lists and Privacy Badger, Privacy Badger can automatically discover new trackers that list-based blockers don't know about.

Besides automatic learning, Privacy Badger comes with other advantages like cookie blocking, widget replacement, and Facebook/Google link cleaning.

Privacy Badger is also a political tool. Privacy Badger sends the [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) signal to opt you out of data sharing and selling, and the [Do Not Track](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track) signal to tell companies not to track you. If trackers ignore your wishes, Privacy Badger will learn to block them. By using Privacy Badger, you support the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) and help fight for a better Web for everybody.
