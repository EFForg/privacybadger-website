Privacy Badger should be compatible with other extensions.

While there is likely to be overlap between the various advertising/tracker lists and Privacy Badger, Privacy Badger can automatically discover new trackers that list-based blockers don't know about.

Besides automatic learning, Privacy Badger comes with other advantages like cookie blocking, widget replacement, and Facebook/Google link cleaning.

Some extension-specific notes:

Adblock Plus does not block invisible trackers by default.

uBlock Origin is an excellent privacy tool. uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger should work well together. Similarly to adblockers, uBlock Origin protects using manually curated blocklists. Privacy Badger protects by automatically learning about trackers as you browse. This means Privacy Badger might catch things that uBlock Origin doesn't know about. (Privacy Badger will learn about far fewer trackers when used together with uBlock Origin, but that's OK.)
