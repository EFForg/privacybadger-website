question: Is Privacy Badger compatible with Firefox's built-in content blocking?

It's fine to use Firefox's native content blocking and Privacy Badger together.

While there is overlap between Firefox's tracker lists and Privacy Badger's protections, unlike list-based blockers, Privacy Badger automatically discovers trackers as you browse the Web. This means your Privacy Badger can learn to block tracking that list-based blockers don't know about.
