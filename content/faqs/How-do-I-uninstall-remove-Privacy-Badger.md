Firefox: See the ["How to remove extensions and themes"](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/disable-or-remove-add-ons#w_how-to-remove-extensions-and-themes) Mozilla Support page.

Chrome: See the ["Install and manage extensions"](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769?hl=en) Chrome Web Store help page.

Opera: Click the menu button in the top left of the window, and then click "Extensions" and then "Manage Extensions." Scroll until you see Privacy Badger, move your mouse over it, and then click the "X" icon in the upper right. Click "OK" to confirm removal. You can then safely close the Extensions tab.
