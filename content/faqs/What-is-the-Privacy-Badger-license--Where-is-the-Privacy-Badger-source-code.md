Privacy Badger is GPLv3 code. You can find Privacy Badger [on GitHub](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger). There is a [development mailing list](https://lists.eff.org/mailman/listinfo/privacybadger). Privacy Badger is governed by EFF's [Privacy Policy for Software](https://www.eff.org/code/privacy).
