msgid "Privacy Badger is a browser extension that stops advertisers and other third-party trackers from secretly tracking where you go and what pages you look at on the web.  If an advertiser seems to be tracking you across multiple websites without your permission, Privacy Badger automatically blocks that advertiser from loading any more content in your browser.  To the advertiser, it's like you suddenly disappeared.\n"
msgstr "隐私獾是一个浏览器扩展程序，它可以阻止广告商和其他第三方跟踪器秘密跟踪您去哪里，以及您在网上看什么网页。 如果一个广告商似乎在未经您允许的情况下在多个网站上跟踪您，隐私獾会自动阻止该广告商在您的浏览器中加载更多内容。 对广告商来说，您就像突然消失了一样。\n"

msgid "Privacy Badger was born out of our desire to be able to recommend a single extension that would automatically analyze and block any tracker or ad that violated the principle of user consent; which could function well without any settings, knowledge, or configuration by the user; which is produced by an organization that is unambiguously working for its users rather than for advertisers; and which uses algorithmic methods to decide what is and isn't tracking.\n"
msgstr "隐私獾的诞生源于我们希望能够推荐一个能够自动分析并阻止任何违反用户同意原则的追踪器或广告的扩展；它能够在不需要用户进行任何设置、了解或配置的情况下很好地发挥作用；它是由一个毫不含糊地为用户而不是为广告商工作的组织生产的；它使用算法来决定是或不是追踪。\n"

msgid "As a result, Privacy Badger differs from traditional ad-blocking extensions in two key ways. First, while most other blocking extensions prioritize blocking ads, Privacy Badger is purely a tracker-blocker. The extension doesn’t block ads unless they happen to be tracking you; in fact, one of our goals is to incentivize advertisers to adopt better privacy practices. Second, most other blockers rely on a human-curated list of domains or URLs to block. Privacy Badger is an algorithmic tracker blocker -- we define what “tracking” looks like, and then Privacy Badger blocks or restricts domains that it observes tracking in the wild. What is and isn’t considered a tracker is entirely based on how a specific domain acts, not on human judgment. ([See also](#Is-Privacy-Badger-compatible-with-other-extensions%2c-including-other-adblockers).)\n"
msgstr "因此，隐私獾在两个关键方面有别于传统的广告拦截扩展。首先，其他大多数拦截扩展都优先拦截广告，而隐私獾纯粹是一个追踪器拦截器。该扩展不会阻止广告，除非它们碰巧在追踪您；事实上，我们的目标之一是激励广告商采取更好的隐私做法。第二，其他大多数拦截器都是依靠人工计算的域名或URL列表来进行拦截。隐私獾是一个算法跟踪器拦截器--我们定义“跟踪”是什么样子，然后隐私獾拦截或限制它观察到的野外跟踪域。是或不被认为是跟踪器，完全基于特定域的行为方式，而非人类的判断。([参见](#Is-Privacy-Badger-compatible-with-other-extensions%2c-including-other-adblockers)。)\n"

(For example, a news webpage might load the actual article from the news company, ads from an ad company, and the comments section from a different company that's been contracted out to provide that service.)  Privacy Badger keeps track of all of this.  If as you browse the web, the same source seems to be tracking your browser across different websites, then Privacy Badger springs into action, telling your browser not to load any more content from that source.  And when your browser stops loading content from a source, that source can no longer track you.  Voila!\n"
